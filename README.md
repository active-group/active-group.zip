# Zippers

A Clojure zipper library that improves upon `clojure.zip`.

In particular, it makes the data types that zipper can work over
extensible and supports a notion of compositionality.

The ideas in `active-group.zippers` is stolen from [Alex Miller's blog
post](http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/10/22/zippers-with-records-in-clojure/).
